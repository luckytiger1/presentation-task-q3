## Blockchain

Hello, my name is Daniyar Ketebay. I am an electrical engineering student studying in Turkey. Today I want to talk about blockchain, it's history, why it became so popular and it's future.

The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.

```
<slide 2>
```

In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design. which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.
However, this technology went unused and the patent lapsed in 2004, four years before the inception of Bitcoin.

```
<slide 3>
```

In 2004, computer scientist and cryptographic activist Hal Finney (Harold Thomas Finney II) introduced a system called RPoW, Reusable Proof Of Work.
The system worked by receiving a non-exchangeable or a non-fungible **Hashcash** based proof of work token and in return created an RSA-signed token that could then be transferred from person to person.
RPoW can be considered as an early prototype and a significant early step in the history of cryptocurrencies.

```
<slide 4>

Developer(s) working under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper establishing the model for a blockchain in 2008.
In short, Bitcoins are “mined” for a reward using the proof-of-work mechanism by individual miners and then verified by the decentralized nodes in the network.
The first recipient of Bitcoin was Hal Finney, he received 10 bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto in the world's first bitcoin transaction on 12 January 2009.

```
<slide 5>
```

On the 3rd of January 2009, Bitcoin came to existence when the first bitcoin block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.

```
<slide 6>
```

Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and to reduce speed with which blocks are added to the chain.

```

In 2013, Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of the Bitcoin Magazine stated that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for building decentralized applications. Failing to gain agreement in the community, Vitalik started the development of a new blockchain-based distributed computing platform, Ethereum, that featured a scripting functionality, called smart contracts.

### What is Blockchain?

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.

```
<slide 9>
```

### Why Blockchain became so popular?

1. It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralized
2. Information in blockchains is viewable by all participants and cannot be altered. This will reduce risk and fraud, and create trust.
3. The blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with the data that is inside the blockchain
4. To speed transactions, a set of rules – called a smart contract – is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.
5. The distributed and encrypted nature of blockchain means it will be difficult to hack. This shows promise for business and IoT security.

```
<slide 10>
```

### Decentralization

An example of a centralized system is the banks. They store all your money, and the only way that you can pay someone is by going through the bank.
Centralized networks have some flaws.
Firstly, because they are centralized, all the data is stored in one spot. This makes them easy target spots for potential hackers.
If the centralized network somehow shuts down for whatever reason? That way nobody will be able to access the information that it possesses.
In a decentralized system, the information is not stored by one single entity. Everyone in the network owns the information. If you want to make transactions with your friends, you can do it without going through the third party. That was the main ideology behind Bitcoins.

```
<slide 11>
```

### Transparency

One of the most interesting concepts in blockchain technology is transparency. The following snapshot of Etherium transactions will show that while the person’s real identity is secure, you will still see all the transactions that were done by their public address.
Speaking purely from cryptocurrency, if you know the public address of one of these big companies, you can simply pop it in an explorer and look at all the transactions that they have engaged in.

```
<slide 12>
```

### Immutability

No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.
The reason why the blockchain gets this property is that of the cryptographic hash function.
Bitcoin uses SHA-256 which gives an output of a fixed length, the output will always have a fixed 256-bits length.

```
<slide 13>
```

### Hash functions generates a unique value

There are certain properties that a cryptographic hash function needs to have to be considered secure. One property that I want you to focus on today is called the Avalanche Effect. Even if one character will change in input data, it will generate a new unique Hash again.

```
<slide 14>
```

### A chain of blocks

The blockchain is a linked list that contains data and a hash pointer that points to its previous block, hence creating the chain. What is a hash pointer? A hash pointer is similar to a pointer, but instead of just containing the address of the previous block it also contains the hash of the data inside the previous block.

```
<slide 15>
```

### Smart contracts

Smart contracts – self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology – automatically trigger actions or payments once conditions are met. Shortly, they will use real-time information, such as asset GPS data, to trigger an event, such as a transfer of ownership and funds.

Smart contracts… guarantee a very, very specific set of outcomes. There’s never any confusion and there’s never any need for litigation.

```
<slide 16>
```

### Smart contracts are awesome!

Autonomy – You’re the one making the agreement; there’s no need to rely on a broker, lawyer.
Trust – Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger. There’s no way that someone can say they lost it.
Backup – Imagine if your bank lost your savings account. On the blockchain, each and every one of your friends has your back. Your documents are duplicated many times over.
Savings – Smart contracts save you money since they knock out the presence of an intermediary. You would, for instance, have to pay a notary to witness your transaction.
Accuracy – Automated contracts are not only faster and cheaper but also avoid the errors that come from manually filling out heaps of forms.

### What are the Use Cases and Applications of Blockchain Technology?

Blockchain technology’s innovative characteristics include decentralization, transparency, immutability, and automation. These elements can be applied to various industries, creating a multitude of use cases. Here are what we believe to be the most pertinent blockchain use cases for enterprises and governments:

```
<slide 18>
```

### Banking and Finance

Banking and financial services struggle with archaic operational processes, slow payment settlements, limited transparency, and security vulnerabilities.

Blockchain technology can solve these problems with accountable and transparent governance systems, improved incentive alignment between stakeholders, secure technology infrastructure, and efficient business models.

```
<slide 19>
```

### Energy and Sustainability

Oil and gas companies suffer from siloed infrastructures and several issues concerning transparency, efficiency, and optimization.

Enterprise Ethereum has the potential to significantly increase business process efficiencies and reduce costs associated with oil and gas operations and distribution.

```
<slide 20>
```

### Healthcare and the Life Sciences

Misinformation, data silos, and the lack of communication between patients, providers, hospitals, and doctors plague the healthcare world.

Blockchain-based data sovereignty and permissioned exchange scenarios will lead to faster, more efficient, and more secure medical data management and drug and medical device tracking. This could significantly improve patient care, facilitate the advancement to medical discoveries, ensure the authenticity of drugs circulating global markets, and more.

```
<slide 21>
```

### Media and Entertainment

Digital piracy, fraudulent copies, infringed studio intellectual property, and duplication of digital items cost the entertainment industry costs the US film and TV industry an estimated \$71 billion annually.

Enterprise Ethereum can create a distributed ledger to track the life cycle of any content, which has the potential to drastically reduce piracy of intellectual property, protect digital content, and facilitate the distribution of authentic digital collectibles.

```
<slide 22>
```

### International Trade and Commodities

Trade financing and commodities exchange systems rely heavily on paper records that are prone to fraud, human error, and delays.

Enterprise Ethereum can optimize financing processes and accelerate industry operations by providing a secure, streamlined, and paperless solution. With blockchain, every element of the trade finance process can be digitized, and only authorized parties can access data, validate documentation, and execute transactions.

```
<slide 23>
```

### Sports and Esports

Various blockchain use cases exist for sports organizations, teams, and fans. Ethereum enabled smart contracts could streamline existing operations, provide new revenue models, and enhance fan engagement with enhanced loyalty programs and incentives.
Blockchain technology can also create real-time sports betting with provably fair outcomes. Lastly, Ethereum enables the use of smart contract-based payouts which eliminates traditional intermediaries that take significant cuts.

```
<slide 24>
```

### Real Estate

Real estate investments are often inaccessible to many. Currently, it offers investors limited liquidity while requiring the involvement of multiple intermediaries, resulting in higher transaction costs.

Enterprise Ethereum’s smart contracts enhance real estate operations by eliminating intermediaries and optimizing processes. Furthermore, blockchain technology allows industries to digitize assets and financial instruments. This enables the fractionalization of ownership, increased liquidity, and democratized access to real estate investment opportunities.
